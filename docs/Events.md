# Events

An Event resource is generated when something occurs on the Okanjo platform. Events can pass along greatly differing data
sets, but all will be centered around the event that took place (E.g. Data about a product being updated will be sent when
a `updated_product` event occurs. Data about these events are transmitted by webhook to a third party URL at their request.

# Objects

* [`Event`](Objects.html#Event) â€“ Event object (transmitted to client)
* [`Event Subscription`](Objects.html#EventSubscription) - A subscription record for an event type to a URL

# Important Notes

If you have configured events, they will come from one of two IP addresses: `96.30.254.41` and `96.30.254.43`. These
addresses should not change, but if they do they will be reported here.

# Workflow Example

For this example, we're going to subscribe to the event that is triggered whenever a user uploads a product to Okanjo.

First, make sure you have your destination endpoint and URL in place. For this example I'm using
[Request Bin](http://requestb.in). This is important because Okanjo will test the URL you give it before letting you
subscribe to an event. Now that you're ready to subscribe to an event, send a POST request to `/events/subscribe` with the
`type` and `webhook_url` entity data:

```
type=added_product

webhook_url=http://requestb.in/1230vpw1
```


Okanjo will attempt to send a JSON-encoded POST request to the supplied `webhook_url` to test the validity:

```js
["This was a triumph","I'm making a note here:","HUGE SUCCESS"]
```


If that POST request returns a successful response code of 200, you will receive a "success" JSON response:

```js
{"type": "success"}
```


Now, whenever somebody adds a product to your marketplace, the system will send information about the event to
your webhook URL. The contents will look something like this, which will include the product information in the `data` section:

```js

If you did it right, well done. Now, while you trust Okanjo, you want to verify it as well.
If you send a GET request to `events/<event_id>`, where `<event_id>` in this case is the ID from above, "EVJyCMRfV7AEEg4zVMbA".
If done properly, the response you get will exactly match the data you received.
