# Regions

Regions represent standardized [DMA](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/cities-DMAregions) codes.

Regions are used for localized experiences on the okanjo platform.

Okanjo uses region id `0` to represent the Everywhere region, referring to all possible regions. It may also be used when no region can be derived.
